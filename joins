-- Step 1: Create the database
CREATE DATABASE JoinsDB;

-- Step 2: Use the database
USE JoinsDB;

-- Step 3: Create the Departments table
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Step 4: Create the Employees table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT
);

-- Step 5: Insert sample data into Departments
INSERT INTO Departments (DepartmentID, DepartmentName) VALUES
(10, 'HR'),
(20, 'IT'),
(40, 'Marketing');
select* from Departments;
-- Step 6: Insert sample data into Employees
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 10),
(2, 'Bob', 20),
(3, 'Charlie', 30),  -- No matching Department
(4, 'David', NULL);  -- No Department assigned
select* from Employees;
-- step 7: Inner Join
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
-- step 7: Left Join 
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
-- step 8: Right Join
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
RIGHT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
-- step 9: Full join
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID
UNION
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
RIGHT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
