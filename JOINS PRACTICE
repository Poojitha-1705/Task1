-- Step 1: Create the database
CREATE DATABASE JoinsDB;

-- Step 2: Use the database
USE JoinsDB;

-- Step 3: Create Departments table
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Step 4: Create Employees table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT
);

-- Step 5: Insert data into Departments
INSERT INTO Departments (DepartmentID, DepartmentName) VALUES
(10, 'HR'),
(20, 'IT'),
(40, 'Marketing');

-- Step 6: View Departments data
SELECT * FROM Departments;

-- Step 7: Insert data into Employees
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 10),
(2, 'Bob', 20),
(3, 'Charlie', 30),  -- No matching department
(4, 'David', NULL);  -- No department assigned

-- Step 8: View Employees data
SELECT * FROM Employees;

-- Step 9: INNER JOIN
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;

-- Step 10: LEFT JOIN
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;

-- Step 11: RIGHT JOIN
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
RIGHT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;

-- Step 12: FULL OUTER JOIN (Simulated using UNION)
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID

UNION

SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
RIGHT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
